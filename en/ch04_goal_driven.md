# Ch.04 Guide Agents with Goals and Acceptance Checks

> **Problem**: Vague requests invite wrong assumptions; overly detailed steps constrain implementation.
>
> **Practice**: Write a task with a goal, scope, constraints, and runnable acceptance checks.

Regardless of model, a task that only lists steps is hard to evaluate without acceptance checks. When several implementations are valid, specify the goal, constraints, and verification before choosing the implementation.

This chapter shares how to guide Codex using a professional "Product Specs" approach in actual development.

## A Way to Think About It: Michelin Chef and the Order Ticket

Many people dispatch tasks to AI like an unruly customer barging into a Michelin kitchen:

```text
【Babysitting Commands (Process-Driven)】 ──> ❌ "Chef, take the knife in your left hand, chop potatoes into 2mm strips, heat the oil to 180°C, stir for 3 minutes, then add 3g salt."
                                              (The chef feels insulted, and if stove pressure shifts slightly, the dish burns.)
【Architect Spec Order (Goal-Driven)】   ──> ✅ "Chef, I need pan-seared crispy potatoes as a steak side dish:
                                              - Goal: Crispy texture, dinner side dish;
                                              - Constraints: Under 200 kcal, strictly NO butter or peanuts (customer allergy);
                                              - Validation: Plated within 15 minutes, core temperature at 75°C."
```

Codex is an algorithmic master chef. Your role is defining what to make, what cannot be touched, and how success is measured—leaving the heat and chopping technique to the agent.

## Practice: Start with Three Steps

Draft your first Goal-Driven Spec in 3 steps:

1. **Step 1: Define the End State (Goal)**  
   State the deliverable in one sentence: "Implement Stripe payment session creation at `/api/checkout`".
2. **Step 2: Enforce Inviolable Guardrails (Constraints)**  
   List 2-3 boundaries: "Never log secret keys in plain text; do not modify global middleware".
3. **Step 3: Provide Automated Verification Assertions (Validation)**  
   Give a runnable command: "Running `npm test -- checkout.test.ts` must pass 100% on the first run".

## 4.1 The Goal-Driven Markdown Specs Template

When triggering coding tasks in your terminal or ChatGPT Desktop, use this structured Markdown layout:

```markdown
# 🎯 Goal
[Describe desired business outcome. Example: Implement GitHub OAuth login route and persist preferences.]

# 🛑 Constraints
- [Security: Never commit credentials or write keys to log streams.]
- [Stack: Strictly use existing Tailwind classes; do not introduce new UI libraries.]
- [Anti-pollution: Prohibited from editing any file under src/legacy/.]

# 🧪 Validation Specs
- [Automated Testing: Running `npm run test:unit` must pass 100%.]
- [Edge behaviors: If inputs are missing, return 400 Bad Request with structured JSON error payloads.]
```

## 4.2 Real Case Comparison: Traditional Prompt vs. Goal-Driven Specs

Suppose we need to write a **"Redis-based Rate-Limiting API Proxy Service"**.

### ❌ Traditional Process-Driven Prompt
> "Please help me write an API proxy with Express. First, import express and express-rate-limit. Then configure rate-limiting, setting windowMs to 15 minutes and max to 100. Then write a route `/api/proxy` using axios to request the third-party API `https://api.github.com`. If successful, return the data; if it fails, return a 500 error. Make sure to include the Authorization Bearer Token in the headers."

### ✅ Goal-Driven Specs

```markdown
# 🎯 Goal
Implement an Express API proxy route that forwards all incoming requests safely to the GitHub API.

# 🛑 Constraints
- Must use Redis as the rate-limiting data source (no memory-based limiting) to support multi-container scaling.
- Limit proxy request timeout strictly to 3000ms to prevent hanging the Node event loop.
- Never write the GitHub token into the codebase or logs; fetch securely from `process.env.GH_TOKEN`.

# 🧪 Validation Specs
- Under simulated load: return 429 Too Many Requests when requests exceed 60 req/min.
- Fault tolerance: return 504 Gateway Timeout with structured JSON on timeouts or network drops.
```

## 4.3 GPT-5.6 Terra Reasoning Architecture for Specs

When presented with this spec, Codex breaks down the solution chain:

```text
[Parse Specs Goal] ──> Analyze Constraints (Redis rate-limit / 3s timeout / Secret isolation)
                            │
                            ▼
[Self-Directed Architecture] ──> Import ioredis + rate-limit-redis, configure Axios abort controllers
                            │
                            ▼
[Align with Validation Specs] ──> Simulate 429 rate limit & timeout fallbacks in unit tests
                            │
                            ▼
[Self-Heal Code Until Tests Pass 100%] ──> Deliver clean code with green verification reports
```

**Delegate logic planning to AI, but keep verification standards firmly in your own hands.**

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting & Pitfall Cheat Sheet

| Symptom | Root Cause | Instant Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overly fragmented steps cause agent to freeze on errors** | Procedural commands stripped GPT-5.6 of self-healing planning space | Strip out implementation steps; retain only Goal, Constraints, and Validation |
| **Agent modified unrelated files, breaking other features** | Lacked directory scope constraints | Declare strict boundaries: "Edits restricted to `src/modules/auth/`; never touch other directories" |
| **Agent claimed completion, but logic has fatal flaws** | Missing automated validation assertions | Add explicit requirement: "Must run `npm test` and produce green unit test assertions" |
