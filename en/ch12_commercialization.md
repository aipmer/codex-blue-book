# Ch.12 From Product Usage to Acquisition Experiments

> **Problem**: Shipping features does not show whether users complete key flows or where they drop off.
>
> **Practice**: Define a few business metrics, build a digest, and test acquisition channels in small reversible experiments.

On my WeChat public account "Real-World Product Talk" and [pmer.cn](https://pmer.cn), I have written numerous articles about "independent development and side hustles." The most common trap developers fall into is: **optimizing implementation details without checking whether real users need the feature.**

No matter how elegant your code is or how perfect your architecture config is, as long as nobody uses it, it is just a pretty ornament. In the AI-native era, we must not only let Codex help us "manufacture products," but also let it help us "spin the commercial flywheel."

## A Way to Think About It: Building a Day-and-Night Self-Spinning "Hydraulic Irrigation Waterwheel"

A commercial flywheel shouldn't depend on hauling water buckets by hand every day:

```text
[Manual Bucket Hauling] ──> Writing code until midnight, then handing out flyers manually the next morning.
                            If you get sick for a single day, product updates stall and traffic drops to zero (fragile).
[Hydraulic Waterwheel]  ──> ✅ You assemble this self-spinning waterwheel by the river:
                            1. The Flume (SEO & automated sitemaps: continuously absorbing long-tail search traffic);
                            2. The Milling Blades (Core SaaS features: solving real problems for real users);
                            3. The Grain Funnel (Stripe checkout & subscriptions: continuously generating cash flow);
                            4. The Water Level Gauge (Daily telemetry cards: monitoring conversion rates and active users).
```

Once this pipeline is assembled, whether you are sleeping, eating, or traveling, the waterwheel spins day and night, generating compounding value.

## Practice: Start with Three Steps

Take your first step toward commercialization in 3 simple steps:

1. **Step 1: Deploy an Automated Sitemap Generation Script**  
   Run `scripts/generate-sitemap.js` automatically in your deployment pipeline to ensure every new markdown post or route gets indexed by Google.
2. **Step 2: Hook Up an 8:00 AM Daily Revenue Telemetry Digest**  
   Configure a scheduled script that pushes yesterday's new signups and active subscriptions to your phone every morning, sharpening your business sensitivity.
3. **Step 3: Post Your "One-Sentence Value Proposition" in Public Communities**  
   Share your MVP link on X (Twitter), Reddit, or developer forums to gather real payment signals from your first seed cohort.

## 12.1 Automated Traffic Pipeline for a "One-Person SaaS"

For a healthy indie project, traffic acquisition (SEO, long-tail keywords, social media) should function as an automated conveyor belt just like its codebase.

### Practice: Directing Codex to Autonomously Maintain SEO Blogs and Sitemaps

```javascript
// File: scripts/generate-sitemap.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const BASE_URL = 'https://pmer.cn';
const blogDir = path.join(__dirname, '../content/blog');

function getBlogSlugs() {
  if (!fs.existsSync(blogDir)) return [];
  return fs.readdirSync(blogDir)
    .filter(file => file.endsWith('.md'))
    .map(file => `/blog/${file.replace('.md', '')}`);
}

function generate() {
  const staticPages = ['/', '/auth/login', '/features'];
  const blogPages = getBlogSlugs();
  const allUrls = [...staticPages, ...blogPages];

  const xml = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  ${allUrls.map(url => `
  <url>
    <loc>${BASE_URL}${url}</loc>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>${url === '/' ? '1.0' : '0.8'}</priority>
  </url>`).join('')}
</urlset>`;

  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../public/sitemap.xml'), xml);
  console.log('✅ Sitemap.xml generated successfully!');
}

generate();
```

## 12.2 Connecting Business Data for Daily Telemetry

To keep yourself sensitive to cash flow dynamics, fetch Stripe earnings and user growth every morning and broadcast a report straight to your phone:

```javascript
// File: scripts/daily-report.js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const axios = require('axios');

async function sendReport() {
  const yesterday = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
    where: { createdAt: { gte: yesterday } }
  });

  const activeSubs = await prisma.subscription.count({
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });

  const reportText = `📊 [Real-World Product Briefing]\nNew registered users yesterday: ${userCount}\nTotal active subscriptions: ${activeSubs}\n—— Keep going!`;

  await axios.post(process.env.MOBILE_WEBHOOK_URL, {
    msg_type: 'text',
    content: { text: reportText }
  });
}

sendReport();
```

## 12.3 What Still Matters When Code Is Easier to Produce

As code generation becomes faster, understanding needs, reaching users, and delivering reliable service still determine whether people keep using a product. For independent developers and product managers, useful strengths include:

1. **Understanding the user's actual problem**.
2. **Knowledge of the domain and its constraints**.
3. **The ability to test a product and business assumption with evidence**.

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting & Pitfall Cheat Sheet

| Common Pitfall | Root Cause | Rapid Diagnosis & Fix Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product launched with zero traffic for a month** | Siloed development without early SEO or social seeding | Share your building journey on X/Twitter/Indie Hackers immediately; use scripts to output multilingual long-tail blog posts |
| **Obsessing over refactoring and afraid to ship or tweet** | Perfectionist trap and fear of public criticism | Remember: as long as core checkout works, ship minor flaws and iterate based on real feedback |
| **Wasting half a day on minor layout tweaks** | Failing to delegate visual micro-adjustments to Codex | Use Computer Use (from Ch.07) for automated visual verification, freeing your time to talk to paying customers |
